At the moment, I'm not available for freelance work. However, if you'd like to get in touch to see how [Otterdev](https://otterdev.io) can help your company, you can drop me an email at [soham@otterdev.io](mailto:soham@otterdev.io), or book a call with me directly via [this link](https://timesync.novocall.co/soham/otterdev-discuss).

At Otterdev, we help our clients **launch** and **scale** by providing you with efficient processes, well thought out technical decisions and designs that convert.  

### Launch

The launch phase encompasses a variety of things, mainly focused around the most efficient way of getting a new thing out. Under this, we've helped companies build new version of their SaaS products, redesign new user flows, create new brand identities and much more. 

### Scale

On the growth side of things, we work with companies that have products that are established, but are struggling to take it to the next level.
